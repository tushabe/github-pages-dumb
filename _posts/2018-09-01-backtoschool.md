On Jan 8th 2018, I will be returning to school after 5 years of being away (*read running away) from the conventional classroom along with the testing practices that come with it. 

My exist out of school four years ago was not nearly as pleasant as I hoped it would be. I barely had time to attend my classes, missed many tests and one final exam which I ended up doing a year later pushing out my graduation and if the cherry on top was that I went ahead to miss my own college graduation because well, I was in another country attending to other distractions. 

Over the years as I have seen several friends returning to school to do a masters or PhD, I wondered to myself on what it would possess me to return to a system of academic inflation that I think is fundamentally broken.  And a couple of ideas came to mind. 
1. The goal behind what I am studying would have to be very clear but not rigid so as to allow room for pivoting based on learnings as we go. Getting a title or a Certification is not a goal. I personally believe we have very many Dr/PhDs in the world today, we certainly don’t need more titles. 
2. The content of what I was learning would have to be immediately actionable and thus relevant to current real problem. 
3. The duration of the course/training would have to be short enough to allow me to get quick feedback on it’s effectiveness on the weekly (waiting a month before I see benefit or lack there of is much too big/risky an investment). 

After much consideration and thought, i will be returning to school to attempt to turn the patchy Germany I have acquired over the past 2 months into fluency. 

The institution I have picked for this endeavor is Goete institute which comes with much recommendation from others. The course is a 4 week immersive one and this duration so I’ll be able to check-in on progress and value for time on the weekly. 
I plan to spend the rest of the year in Germany doing software consultancy so I see an immediate benefit to being fluent in German and lastly as much as there an option to do a certification exam after, It is not required or necessary to achieve my goal, being verbally fluent in German. 

I have pencil and notebook in my backpack, I got another alarm clock with a much louder gong. 
First class is tomorrow morning at 8am.. the funny part is that nothing about preparing for school feels new or weird at all, it’s like I never left.
